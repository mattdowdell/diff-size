name: "Diff Size"
description: |
  This action adds a label to each pull request based on the number of lines changes. The
  calculation excludes vendored and generated files as indicated by the `.gitattributes` file.

  There is a limit to how much code can be effectively reviewed in a single pull request. A
  [Smartbear study][1] found that reviewing more than 200-400 lines reduces the ability of reviewers
  to identify defects. Smaller changes can also support a high deployment frequency, as they are
  usually less risky and require less effort to qualify.

  To allow better identification of problem pull requests, each pull request is categorised
  as follows. The thresholds for each category and the label names can be adjusted using the action
  inputs. The labels will be created when the action is run for the first time.

  | Category          | Lines changed | Label      |
  | ----------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
  | Extra Small       | 1-10          | `size/XS`  |
  | Small             | 11-100        | `size/S`   |
  | Medium            | 101-200       | `size/M`   |
  | Large             | 201-400       | `size/L`   |
  | Extra Large       | 401-800       | `size/XL`  |
  | Extra Extra Large | 801+          | `size/XXL` |

  This size calculation will be the number of lines removed plus the number of lines added. Any
  files that have been marked as vendored or generated in `.gitattributes` are excluded from the
  calculation, for example:

  ```
  vendor/**    linguist-vendored
  generated/** linguist-generated
  ```

  More details on `.gitattributes` overrides can be found [here][2]. A file that was newly
  classified as generated or vendored will be removed from the calculation. Conversely, a modified
  file that has been unclassified will be included, but only the changed lines will be considered.
