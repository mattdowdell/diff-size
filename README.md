# pr-size

A GitHub Action for labelling pull requests with size categories.

<!-- TODO: Add picture -->
<!-- 100 chars ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

There is a limit to how much code can be effectively reviewed in a single pull
request. A [Smartbear study][1] found that reviewing more than 200-400 lines
reduces the ability of reviewers to identify defects. Furthermore, smaller
changes are typically lower risk and require less effort to qualify. With that
in mind, this action seeks to promote smaller pull requests by making it easier
to identify excessively large changes.

Each pull request is assigned a label that identifies its size. The thresholds
for the sizes and the names of the labels can be customised using the
[action inputs](#inputs).

| Category          | Lines changed | Label      |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Extra Small       | 1-10          | `size/XS`  |
| Small             | 11-100        | `size/S`   |
| Medium            | 101-200       | `size/M`   |
| Large             | 201-400       | `size/L`   |
| Extra Large       | 401-800       | `size/XL`  |
| Extra Extra Large | 801+          | `size/XXL` |

The calculation of the lines changed is determined by adding the number of lines
added and removed in each file. Whitespace only changes to lines, such as
indentation modifications are excluded. Additionally, files that are marked as
generated or vendored in `.gitattributes` are also excluded, allowing automated
changes to be filtered out. For example:

```gitignore
# See https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/docs/overrides.md for further details
vendor/**    linguist-vendored
generated/** linguist-generated
```
